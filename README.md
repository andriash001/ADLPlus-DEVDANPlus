# ADLPlus-DEVDANPlus
Modified version of ADL and DEVDAN: Implement multiple node growing scenario and synapses pruning

This code is the implementation of our ICDMW 2019 AML Workshop paper titled: 
Autonomous Deep Learning: Incremental Learning of Deep Neural Networks for Evolving Data Streams

We extend ADL and DEVDAN by introducing multiple node growing and synapses pruning.
